      recommended</emph> for actual use for encoding documents. It
      produces schemas and reference documentation that will be much
      larger, and include many more elements, than almost anyone could
      conceivably ever need. Tempting though it may be simply to have
      absolutely everything, and <q>just ignore</q> elements not
      required, experience has shown that their presence makes the
      documentation harder to read and use, and makes a schema that is
      far more lax than desired.</p><schemaSpec ident="tei_BETTE_110" start="TEI teiCorpus" prefix="" docLang="en"><moduleRef key="tei"/><!-- required --><moduleRef key="core" except="abbr add addrLine address analytic biblScope biblStruct binaryObject cb choice cit citedRange corr del desc distinct divGen email emph expan foreign gap gb gloss graphic headItem headLabel imprint index item label lb list listBibl measure measureGrp media meeting mentioned milestone monogr note num orig pb postBox postCode ptr q reg relatedItem resp respStmt said series sic soCalled street teiCorpus term textLang time unclear"/><!-- required --><moduleRef key="corpus" except="activity channel constitution derivation domain factuality interaction locale preparedness setting settingDesc"/><moduleRef key="drama" except="camera caption castGroup epilogue move performance prologue set sound spGrp tech view"/><moduleRef key="header" except="appInfo application authority biblFull cRefPattern calendar calendarDesc catDesc catRef category classCode classDecl correction correspAction correspContext correspDesc creation distributor editorialDecl encodingDesc extent funder geoDecl handNote hyphenation interpretation keywords listChange listPrefixDef namespace normalization notesStmt prefixDef projectDesc punctuation quotation refState refsDecl rendition samplingDecl schemaRef scriptNote segmentation seriesStmt sponsor stdVals styleDefDecl tagUsage tagsDecl taxonomy textClass xenoData"/><!-- required --><moduleRef key="linking" except="alt altGrp anchor join joinGrp link linkGrp timeline when"/><moduleRef key="namesdates" except="addName birth bloc climate country death district education event faith floruit forename genName geo geogFeat geogName langKnowledge langKnown listEvent listNym listOrg listPlace listRelation location nameLink nationality nym occupation offset persona place placeName population region relation residence roleName settlement socecStatus state surname terrain trait"/><moduleRef key="textstructure" except="argument byline closer dateline div1 div2 div3 div4 div5 div6 div7 docAuthor docDate docEdition docImprint docTitle epigraph floatingText group imprimatur opener postscript salute signed titlePage titlePart trailer"/><!-- required --></schemaSpec></body></text></TEI>
